# **Module 9: Project Week (Week 10 & 11)**

**Overall Goal:** To provide learners with an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course in a hands-on, self-directed project. This module is designed to foster creativity, problem-solving, and independent learning while reinforcing the concepts and techniques covered in previous modules.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Project Proposal (Beginning of the week):**
    *   Learners will individually or in small groups (2-3 members, depending on class size and project complexity) develop a project proposal outlining their chosen project, its objectives, the intended approach, and the expected outcomes.
    *   The proposal should clearly demonstrate the application of concepts learned in the course, particularly focusing on Transformers, Diffusion Models, or Flow Matching.
    *   The instructor will review and provide feedback on the proposals, ensuring feasibility and alignment with the course objectives.

2. **Project Development (Throughout the week):**
    *   Learners will dedicate the majority of the week to working on their projects.
    *   This includes data collection and preparation (if necessary), model implementation or fine-tuning, experimentation, and evaluation.
    *   The instructor will be available for guidance, mentorship, and troubleshooting throughout the development process. Regular check-ins (e.g., daily stand-ups or scheduled meetings) are encouraged to monitor progress and address any challenges.

3. **Project Presentation (End of the week):**
    *   Each individual or group will present their project to the class.
    *   The presentation should include:
        *   A clear explanation of the project's goals and motivation.
        *   A demonstration of the developed system or model.
        *   A summary of the technical approach, including the chosen architectures, training procedures, and any challenges encountered.
        *   An evaluation of the project's results, including relevant metrics and analysis.
        *   A discussion of the project's limitations and potential future improvements.
    *   A Q\&A session will follow each presentation, allowing for peer feedback and further discussion.

**Project Ideas:**

Here are some project ideas to inspire learners, categorized by the core technologies they might utilize:

**Transformer-Based Projects:**

*   **Fine-tuning a Transformer for a Specific NLP Task:**
    *   **Sentiment Analysis for a Niche Domain:** Fine-tune a model to analyze sentiment in product reviews, social media posts, or customer feedback related to a particular industry or product category.
    *   **Text Classification for a Specialized Dataset:** Train a model to classify text data in a specific domain, such as legal documents, medical records, or scientific publications.
    *   **Named Entity Recognition for a New Language or Domain:** Adapt an existing NER model to identify entities in a language or domain not covered by pre-trained models.
    *   **Question Answering on a Custom Knowledge Base:** Build a QA system that can answer questions based on a specific set of documents or a particular knowledge domain.
*   **Building a Creative Text Generation Application:**
    *   **Story Generation with Specific Themes or Styles:** Fine-tune a GPT model to generate short stories, poems, or scripts based on user-provided themes, keywords, or writing styles.
    *   **Interactive Storytelling:** Create a system where users can interact with a language model to collaboratively write a story.
    *   **Poetry Generation with Style Transfer:** Train a model to generate poems in the style of a particular poet or literary movement.

**Diffusion Model Projects:**

*   **Fine-tuning a Diffusion Model for Image Generation:**
    *   **Style Transfer with Diffusion Models:** Fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model to generate images in the style of a particular artist or art movement.
    *   **Image Inpainting or Outpainting:** Train a diffusion model to fill in missing parts of an image (inpainting) or extend an image beyond its original boundaries (outpainting).
    *   **Image-to-Image Translation:** Fine-tune a diffusion model to translate images from one domain to another (e.g., sketches to realistic images, day to night).
*   **Exploring Conditional Generation with Diffusion Models:**
    *   **Generating Images from Text Descriptions with Specific Attributes:** Fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model to generate images based on detailed text prompts, controlling attributes like color, style, and composition.
    *   **Class-Conditional Image Generation:** Train a diffusion model to generate images of specific classes or categories.
*   **Exploring Variations or Applications of Diffusion Models:**
    *   **Investigating Different Schedulers:** Experiment with different noise schedulers and analyze their impact on the quality and speed of image generation.
    *   **Applying Diffusion Models to Other Data Modalities:** Explore the use of diffusion models for audio or video generation (this might be more challenging).

**Flow Matching Projects:**

*   **Implementing and Experimenting with Flow Matching:**
    *   **Building a Flow Matching Model for a Simple Dataset:** Implement a basic Flow Matching model in PyTorch and train it on a simple dataset (e.g., 2D synthetic data).
    *   **Comparing Different Flow Matching Objectives:** Implement and compare different Flow Matching objectives (e.g., conditional vs. unconditional).
    *   **Visualizing the Learned Vector Field:** Develop visualizations to understand the vector field learned by a Flow Matching model.
*   **Comparing Flow Matching with Diffusion Models:**
    *   **Training a Flow Matching Model and a Diffusion Model on the Same Dataset:** Compare the performance of the two models in terms of sample quality, training stability, and efficiency.
    *   **Analyzing the Trajectories Generated by Each Model:** Compare the paths taken by Flow Matching and Diffusion Models during the generation process.

**Hybrid Projects (Combining Different Techniques):**

*   **Building a Text-to-Image System with a Transformer and a Diffusion Model:** Use a Transformer model (e.g., CLIP) to encode text prompts and a diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to generate images based on the encoded prompts.
*   **Using a Transformer to Generate Prompts for a Diffusion Model:** Train a Transformer model to generate creative or specific text prompts that are then fed into a diffusion model for image generation.

**Project Support and Resources:**

*   **Instructor Guidance:** The instructor will provide regular guidance, feedback, and support throughout the project week.
*   **Office Hours:** Dedicated office hours will be available for students to ask questions, discuss challenges, and receive assistance.
*   **Peer Collaboration:** Learners are encouraged to collaborate with their peers, share ideas, and provide feedback on each other's work.
*   **Computational Resources:** Access to appropriate computational resources (e.g., GPUs) should be ensured for the project week.
