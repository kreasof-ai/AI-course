# **Module 10: Presentations and Future Directions (Weeks 12 - flexible)**

**Overall Goal:** To provide a platform for learners to showcase their projects, engage in peer feedback, and explore the broader context of AI research and development, including emerging trends and future directions. This module aims to foster a sense of accomplishment, encourage further exploration, and inspire continued learning in the rapidly evolving field of AI.

**Week 12: Project Presentations and Peer Feedback**

*   **Duration:** The entire week will be dedicated to project presentations and feedback. The exact schedule will depend on the number of projects and the desired presentation length.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Presentations:** Each individual or group will have a designated time slot (e.g., 15-20 minutes) to present their project.
    *   **Q\&A:** A Q\&A session (e.g., 5-10 minutes) will follow each presentation, allowing the audience (peers and the instructor) to ask questions, provide feedback, and engage in discussion.
    *   **Feedback Forms:**  Structured feedback forms will be provided for learners to evaluate each presentation, focusing on aspects like:
        *   Clarity and organization of the presentation.
        *   Technical soundness of the project.
        *   Effectiveness of the demonstration.
        *   Depth of understanding demonstrated by the presenters.
        *   Overall impact and potential of the project.
*   **Presentation Guidelines:**
    *   **Content:** Presentations should cover the following:
        *   **Introduction:** Project title, team members, motivation, and goals.
        *   **Technical Approach:**  Detailed explanation of the chosen architecture, training methods, datasets used, and any modifications or innovations.
        *   **Demonstration:** Live demo of the working system or model, showcasing its capabilities.
        *   **Results and Evaluation:** Presentation of quantitative results (if applicable), qualitative analysis, and discussion of limitations.
        *   **Conclusion:** Summary of key findings, potential future work, and lessons learned.
    *   **Visual Aids:**  Presentations should be accompanied by clear and informative visual aids (slides, diagrams, etc.).
    *   **Delivery:** Presenters should strive for clarity, conciseness, and engaging delivery.
*   **Instructor's Role:**
    *   The instructor will moderate the presentations, ensuring they stay on schedule.
    *   The instructor will provide feedback and ask clarifying questions during the Q\&A sessions.
    *   The instructor will assess the presentations based on the defined criteria.
*   **Peer Feedback:**
    *   Peer feedback is a crucial component of this module.
    *   Learners are expected to actively participate in the Q\&A sessions and provide constructive feedback using the provided forms.
    *   The quality of peer feedback will contribute to the overall assessment.
*   **Recording (Optional):** Presentations can be recorded (with the consent of the presenters) for future reference and for learners to review their own performance.

**Assessment for Module 10:**

*   **Project Presentations (from Week 12):** This will be the primary assessment for this module.
*   **Peer Feedback (from Week 12):**  The quality and constructiveness of peer feedback will be assessed.

**Key Takeaways for Module 10:**

By the end of this module, learners will have:

*   Showcased their projects and received valuable feedback from their peers and the instructor.
*   Gained a broader perspective on the future of AI and the evolving landscape of research and development.
*   Acquired knowledge about resources and opportunities for continued learning in the field of AI.
*   Reflected on their learning journey throughout the course and identified areas for further exploration.
